In this project, various regression models were trained on a dataset describing the energy usaged in a building in Berkely California
There was a strong focus on data analysis, visualization, feature selection, multicollinearity handling, feature engineering, and machine learning aprroaches for model building in other to predict the consumption of energy.
Data preprocessing and analysis were done to handle missing data and for the standardization of the data formats.
Feature selection was done for choosing the features that were best suited for building accurate prediction models, a correlation analysis was done to effectively perform feauture selection.
Regression models like linear regression, random forest regression, support vector machine regression, and gradient boosting regression models were developed, and a cross-validation test was performed to assess the performance of the models.
Evaluation of these models was done using parameters like Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squred values.
A report was also written on the process and results obatined in this project.
